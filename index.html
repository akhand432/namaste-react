        // Creating of a tag in react is somewhat different than the javascript. Here we are using the React api which is core of react
        // to create the element here createElement is a function which takes three parameters
        // 1. The type of the element we want to create (in this case "h1")
        // 2. The properties of the element (in this case an empty object {})
        // here we can provide the properties of the element like class, id, style etc.
        // If we want to add any properties to the element we can pass it as an object
        // 3. The content of the element (in this case "Namaste React Js")
        // This is we can also say the children of the element.
        // This will create an element of type h1 with the content "Namaste React Js
        // After creating the element we will append it to the root div which is present in the body of the html file.
        // We can also use the React.createElement() function to create elements in react.
        // const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Akhand and Akancha are inseparable");
        // again we are using the ReactDOM to create the root element which is the main entry point of the react application.
        // const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

        // root.render(heading);
        // The render method is used to render the element to the root div which is present in the body of the html file.
        // This will replace the content of the root div with the heading element we created above.
